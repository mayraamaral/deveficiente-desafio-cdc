## Project Overview
This project is a challenge proposed by Alberto Souza as part of the Dev Eficiente course. The objective is to create a 
system (specifically, an API) that simulates the functionality of the Casa do CÃ³digo website, which is an online bookstore.  
The system allows for the management of entities such as authors, books, and purchases, following a structured backend architecture.
## Stack  
 - Language: Java v21;
 - Framework: Spring & Spring Boot;
 - Docs: Swagger/OpenAPI;
 - Database: MySQL (RDBMS).
## Entities  
 - **Author**: Represents the book authors;
 - **Book**: Represents the books available in the store;
 - **Category**: Represents different book categories;
 - **Country**: Represents the countries for user addresses;
 - **State**: Represents states within a country;
 - **Coupon**: Discount coupons applicable to purchases;
 - **Purchase**: Represents customer purchases, including payment details;
 - **PurchaseItem**: Represents individual items within a purchase, linking a specific book to the purchase and 
capturing its quantity.
